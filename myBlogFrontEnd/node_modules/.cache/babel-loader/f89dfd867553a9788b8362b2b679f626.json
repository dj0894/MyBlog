This enables a developer to build one component, and re-use it multiple times as required. This is a powerful advantage over using a template engine, because you no longer have to worry about writing code to build all parts of the UI! To illustrate this, consider the example of Youtube’s homepage.\n            Here, notice how all the video suggestion cards have a similar structure to them.A thumbnail, a title below the thumbnail, the channel name below that, and some more details towards the bottom of the card.Using a client side library like React, you can build a generic component to display all of the above, and re - use that same component multiple times.\n            To leverage this concept, it is important to start thinking of the UI as a structured collection of components.These components can also communicate with one another asynchronously, which can save you some costly page reloads!\n            “But, how do I build these components ?”, you may wonder.Building components mainly comes down to understanding what you want to render for the user, at that instant of time.If you can visualize the end result before you start writing the code, it can make your job a little easier.\n            React offers two ways to define the components.You can either choose to build a class-based component, or you can build a functional component.As the names suggest, the former uses the concept of ES6 Javascript classes(if you are not familiar with it, click here to learn about it) and the latter uses plain - old Javascript functions.`]\n}, {\n  name: 'learn-node',\n  title: 'What is REST ',\n  content: [`Guiding Principles of REST\nClient–server – By separating the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, we improve the portability of the user interface across multiple platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components.\nStateless – Each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client.\nCacheable – Cache constraints require that the data within a response to a request be implicitly or explicitly labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable.
