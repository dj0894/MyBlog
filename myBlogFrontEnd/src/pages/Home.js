                The Welcome blog post article gets you focused on what your blog is about. It helps you confront what you will and won't address in your blog. It helps you get your thoughts together so your business blog isn't all over the content map. Ultimately, it helps you focus. In so doing, you create an environment that truly welcomes readers to your blog.

                Think about it.

                How credible do you consider a blog on artisanal cheeses and wine pairings if it talks about dog grooming one day and cars the next? I would be wondering whether the business was legitimate, the person writing knowledgeable about wine and cheese, and how much I could trust what I was reading. Chances of my returning let alone even subscribing would be slim.
